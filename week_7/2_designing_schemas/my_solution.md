## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 

<!-- display your one-to-one image inline here -->
<a href="https://github.com/StackDaddy/phase_0_unit_3/blob/master/week_7/imgs/One%20to%20One.png">One To One</a>

#I am modeling an website that has data on users bank account info
<!-- display your many-to-many image inline here -->

<a href="https://github.com/StackDaddy/phase_0_unit_3/blob/master/week_7/imgs/Many%20to%20Many.png">Many to Many</a>

#I am modeling the food in a kitchen.  

## Release 5: Reflection

#At first I thought this was going to be easy but it turned out getting a grasp on these concepts turned out to be difficult.  I'm sure I will be more comfortable with them in time, it is just tough to conceptualize these things.
